Hello world,

Sidia Sousa, Software Developer with main focus on backend development, I love tech, sci-fi books, learning new things, music && specially challenges. 
I found myself really falling for coding since an amazing experience contributing in a hackathon project for help people, that's when i figured out what i want to do: through technology we can do so incredible things, build the future and contribute to make the world a better place.
It is fascinating _how many things coding can make possible_... when i am coding it feels like even the most crazy futuristic sci-fi invention can be real, like _anything is possible to be done_  and i love it, so about three years ago i got a no way back ticket to coding journey, challenging myself everyday to become the best dev i can be ðŸš€

## Skills and Tools
Experience with technologies like C, JavaScript, NodeJs, Databases, Git, also built projects using Docker, .NET and Cloud Computing Services (AWS), During to 2018-2020 I took a Software Development technical level course since then I am pursuing my Computer Science degree, Currently working as a Full Time Software Developer challenging myself into mobile platforms development. 

My projects and the cool stuff i made can be found throught this platform, I am always building new things to apply what I learn, searching for new ideas and challenges also love meet new people who share this taste for tech and knowlodge, so feel free to contact me I will appreciate it.

Thank you for reading! ðŸ’™
